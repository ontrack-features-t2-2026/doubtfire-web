# Student submission lifecycle

This implements SLR-H02/H03, the web part of SLR-E03/E04, and frontend regressions
for SLR-E05. It consumes the paired API change; deploy the API first for the new
setting and explanatory deadline metadata.

- Task Details now includes Previous submissions, including when the current
  submission has no PDF. A task never submitted shows an empty history without
  issuing a request for a nonexistent Task.
- The view preserves backend version order and explicit availability, labels the
  current version only when the API confirms it, and identifies the latest
  retained archive. Unknown legacy timestamps have plain-language fallback text.
- Loading and processing states use a polite live region. Failed loads and
  downloads have readable errors and a keyboard-operable refresh action.
- Unavailable versions have no download control. Available archives use the
  existing authenticated HttpClient download service. Changing task clears the
  old list and cancels its request; a late download is discarded after navigation.
- The UI exposes neither staff comparison controls nor internal archive paths.
  The API still rechecks access on every download, including group membership
  and substituted identifiers.
- Unit task Options contains Allow automatic post-feedback extensions with
  future-only help text. The API's existing convenor/admin authorization is the
  authority; normal students and tutors cannot save task-definition changes.
- Task Details shows the API's canonical effective date and reason, including
  the anywhere-on-earth day-end convention. Flexible dates are labelled as the
  student's planned submission date. No frontend deadline calculation is added.

The already merged API E02 policy remains unchanged. The proposal in web PR #249
is explicitly awaiting stakeholder approval and differs from that rule. This
setting therefore refers to the unit's existing resubmission weeks and fixed
date behavior rather than claiming an unapproved seven-days-from-feedback rule.

The new view uses semantic ordered lists, native buttons, accessible download
names, Material theme surfaces and wrapping content without fixed widths. Theme
work may restyle those surfaces without changing history or deadline behavior.

## Checks

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:ci -- --include='src/app/api/services/submission-history.service.spec.ts' --include='src/app/projects/states/dashboard/directives/task-dashboard/directives/previous-submissions/previous-submissions.component.spec.ts' --include='src/app/api/services/task-definition.service.spec.ts' --include='src/app/projects/states/dashboard/directives/task-dashboard/directives/task-description-card/task-description-card.component.spec.ts'
npm run build -- --configuration production
```

The API PR covers access controls, corrupt and removed files, group entitlement,
opt-out permissions, notification replay, deadline rollback and the existing
calendar feed. Human review and real calendar-client refresh sign-off remain
outside this code change.
