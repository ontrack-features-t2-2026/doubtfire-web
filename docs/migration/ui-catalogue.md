# Remaining layout migration catalogue (MG-04)

Verified on 20 September 2026 against web `11.0.x` at `d16f6201caff78082e5e83c540320dbee5871404`.
This is a source inventory, not measured student usage. The workbook's August counts
are historical: **10 occurrences across 2 templates** remain.
Ranking uses route frequency and task relevance, not attribute counts or invented analytics.

| Priority | Template                                                                               | fx occurrences | Rationale                                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | `src/app/projects/states/dashboard/project-dashboard/project-dashboard.component.html` |              9 | Student project dashboard: a frequent task entry point. |
| 2        | `src/app/welcome/welcome.component.html`                                               |              1 | Welcome screen: primarily first entry.                  |

Convert the project dashboard first and welcome second. There is no third candidate
left in this inventory; adding one would misstate the remaining work. Coordinate the
welcome edit with first-time tutorial work and the dashboard with theme/accessibility PRs.

## TypeScript and package wiring

- `src/app/doubtfire-angular.module.ts` (production).

Only the main module still imports `FlexLayoutModule`, which remains in its `imports`
array and supplies the two templates. It is live, so do not remove the dependency yet.
No production or spec `MediaObserver` imports remain at this revision. Earlier audits
reported four production consumers and three specs; those have been migrated.
`MediaObserver` would require Angular CDK `BreakpointObserver`/application logic, not
a direct Tailwind class substitution, if encountered on an older branch.

## Attribute mapping

`fxLayoutAlign` is **main axis first, cross axis second**. For a row,
`fxLayoutAlign="center start"` maps to `justify-center items-start`, not the reverse.

| Directive       | Current occurrences | Replacement / exception                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fxLayout`      |                   2 | `flex flex-row` or `flex flex-col`; preserve breakpoint overrides.                                           |
| `fxFlex`        |                   3 | Per-value decision: `flex-1`, `grow`, `basis-*`, or explicit flex-basis. Do not map every value to `w-full`. |
| `fxLayoutAlign` |                   1 | Map main-axis value to `justify-*`, cross-axis value to `items-*`.                                           |
| `fxFlexFill`    |                   0 | `w-full h-full` with appropriate flex growth after checking the parent.                                      |
| `fxFlexAlign`   |                   0 | `self-*`.                                                                                                    |
| `fxFill`        |                   2 | `w-full h-full`; verify parent dimensions.                                                                   |
| `fxShow`        |                   1 | Conditional visibility / responsive display utilities; expressions need application state.                   |
| `fxHide`        |                   1 | `hidden` plus intended breakpoint display; expressions need application state.                               |

## Bootstrap and Material leftovers

No Bootstrap package is installed. These names are not evidence that Bootstrap still
runs; check component styles before replacing a custom class that happens to share a name.

Material legacy appearance remains at `src/app/units/states/edit/directives/unit-staff-editor/unit-staff-editor.component.html:21`. This is the older button-toggle appearance, not the removed form-field appearance.
