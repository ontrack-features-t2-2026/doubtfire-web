# Manual accessibility regression pack

This is the reusable A11Y-T02 test pack. It is a procedure, not a record of passing tests. Use the [merged baseline](../A11Y-D01-Accessibility-Baseline_Phase1.md) and record results in the format below. The local `npm run test:a11y` gate and [other automated commands](AUTHORING.md#verification-and-pr-evidence) complement these checks; jsdom scans leave contrast, incomplete results, actual keyboard behaviour and assistive-technology output for the relevant browser/manual checks.

## Setup and run record

Use a local development stack with synthetic accounts: a student enrolled in a unit with an available task, and a tutor assigned to that unit with a submission awaiting feedback. Ask the local fixture owner for those accounts; this document contains no credentials. Include a task sheet, an allowed sample submission, existing feedback, an empty queue, and a recoverable validation error. Assessment actions must affect only the synthetic submission.

Record date, tester, web/API/deploy branches and full SHAs, fixture description, role, OS and version, browser and version, screen reader and version, speech/navigation mode, viewport and zoom, theme and reduced-motion setting. Use a browser/screen-reader pairing the tester knows, for example NVDA with Chrome/Firefox or VoiceOver with Safari. Record the actual version instead of writing "latest". Safari keyboard navigation must be enabled if testing Tab navigation there. Desktop, narrow viewport and a real mobile assistive-technology pass are separate results.

For each test use **Pass**, **Fail**, **Not run**, or **Not applicable (reason)**. A known limitation remains a failure when reproduced; it is not a pass. Keep screenshots/recordings free of real names, IDs, marks, submissions, tokens and private URLs. Do not collect health or disability information. Attach sanitised evidence to the relevant GitHub PR.

## Checks used throughout both journeys

| ID  | Exact action                                                                                                                            | Pass condition                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| K1  | Starting from the address bar, press Tab through each task action; reverse with Shift+Tab.                                              | Logical order, visible focus, no unreachable action or focus trap, no hidden control receives focus.                                                                                  |
| K2  | Activate links with Enter and buttons with Enter and Space. Open each select/menu and use its documented arrow keys, Enter and Escape.  | Same result as pointer use, a single activation, no accidental page scroll for button Space.                                                                                          |
| K3  | Open a dialog; inspect its initial focus, Tab/Shift+Tab through it, dismiss with Escape where supported, then reopen and use Cancel.    | Dialog is named, focus stays inside while open, and returns to the invoking control when closed. Required non-dismissible flows provide an operable exit/continue action.             |
| S1  | Use screen-reader heading, landmark and form/control navigation before and after changing route.                                        | Useful page title/orientation, coherent headings, named controls/frames, and no decorative or hidden content presented as an action.                                                  |
| S2  | Focus form fields, enter invalid data, submit, correct the error and submit again.                                                      | Name, role, required/invalid state and help/error relationship are available; values are preserved where appropriate; recovery is understandable.                                     |
| S3  | Trigger loading, search with no results, success and a recoverable failure. Wait for a background refresh.                              | Relevant state is available in text and announced when needed without repeated history, duplicate announcements or interruption on every refresh.                                     |
| V1  | Repeat key steps at 200% and 400% browser zoom, then a 320 CSS pixel viewport.                                                          | Essential text/actions are visible and usable; no page-level two-dimensional scrolling except intrinsically two-dimensional content. Focus is not hidden under fixed headers/footers. |
| V2  | Apply the text-spacing values from the authoring guide and inspect long labels, errors and dialogs.                                     | No clipped text, overlap, missing controls or inaccessible content.                                                                                                                   |
| V3  | Measure text/control/focus contrast in both available themes; inspect statuses without relying on colour.                               | Ordinary text reaches 4.5:1; large text and meaningful controls/graphics reach 3:1. Statuses/warnings have understandable text or shape cues. Record measured pairs.                  |
| V4  | Enable OS reduced motion, reload, and trigger a success state and expandable content. Change the preference while open where supported. | Decorative animation/confetti is suppressed or reduced; essential information remains available as static text/state.                                                                 |
| U1  | Ask an independent reviewer to find the current unit, find a task, open its task sheet, and find progress/status without coaching.      | Wording and next steps are understandable; choices and errors are predictable and recoverable. Record friction and participant observations, not medical information.                 |

## Student journey: enter unit → submit work → read feedback

Routes are verified against [app.routes.ts](../../src/app/app.routes.ts). Replace IDs/abbreviations with the synthetic fixture values; follow the UI rather than pasting a deep link when testing navigation.

| ID  | Action                                                                                                                                 | Expected result and checks                                                                                                                                                         |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ST1 | Sign in at `/sign_in`, go to `/home`, and open the enrolled unit using only the keyboard.                                              | Named inputs, understandable authentication errors, and a keyboard-operable unit link lead to `/projects/:projectId/dashboard`. K1–K2, S1–S2.                                      |
| ST2 | Find an available task, inspect its status/deadline, and select it.                                                                    | Task identity, status and urgency are available without colour alone; selected task context is clear at `/projects/:projectId/dashboard/:taskAbbreviation`. K1–K2, S1.             |
| ST3 | Open the Task Sheet/PDF, search, zoom in/out, and use download/resources actions where present.                                        | Each control has a distinct purpose/name; PDF/frame is named; keyboard can enter and leave the viewer. Document accessibility inside uploaded PDFs separately. K1–K2, S1, V1–V2.   |
| ST4 | Open Upload submission, inspect requirements, choose the synthetic allowed file, exercise a validation failure, correct it and submit. | Dialog focus is managed; file requirements/errors are associated and readable; no failed attempt reports success. Success is available without animation or colour. K3, S2–S3, V4. |
| ST5 | Open feedback, read an existing comment, enter a reply, cancel editing once, then send a synthetic reply.                              | Composer is named and editable by keyboard, existing feedback is readable in sequence, and completion/error feedback is useful without rereading the thread. K1–K3, S1–S3.         |
| ST6 | Repeat ST2–ST5 at zoom/narrow widths and both themes, then complete the four U1 tasks independently.                                   | Record V1–V4 and U1 separately; desktop results do not substitute for mobile or assistive-technology results.                                                                      |

## Staff journey: find submission → claim → review → grade

| ID  | Action                                                                                                                                          | Expected result and checks                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SF1 | Sign in as the synthetic tutor, open the unit and `/units/:unitId/tasks/inbox`; search/filter to the fixture submission and then to no results. | Search and filters are named, empty/loading results explained, row actions reachable without hover. K1–K2, S1–S3.                                           |
| SF2 | Open the submission and use Claim if available for this queue; record Not applicable with reason if the fixture/role offers no claim action.    | The correct submission remains selected, claim action is keyboard operable, result understandable. A role restriction is not bypassed to satisfy this test. |
| SF3 | Review the submitted PDF/files, existing discussion and task status, and add synthetic feedback.                                                | Useful document/control names, focus can leave embedded content, named composer and single useful save result. K1–K3, S1–S3.                                |
| SF4 | Open the task grading/quality dialog, select an allowed grade/rating, cancel, reopen and save.                                                  | Named dialog and grade/rating control; announced value/state; focus restoration; assessment action applies once. K2–K3, S2–S3.                              |
| SF5 | With a permitted moderation fixture, inspect `/units/:unitId/tasks/moderation` and the uphold/overturn controls.                                | Each action has a distinct name and visible focus; purpose is clear before activation. Do not change non-demo assessment data.                              |
| SF6 | Repeat SF1–SF5 with V1–V4. Complete U1 independently, using the tutor's available unit/task views.                                              | Record every check with its actual environment and fixture limitations.                                                                                     |

## Finding, evidence and re-test record

Preserve the baseline's finding fields. Add a test-run row for status and follow-up links rather than replacing the finding fields.

| Finding field   | Entry                                                                                              |

| Actual Result   | Observed result; include useful spoken output verbatim                                             |
| Severity        | P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 with task-impact reason                                                          |
| Evidence        | Sanitised recording, screenshot, measured pair or log                                              |
| Owner           | Responsible team/person, or unassigned                                                             |
| Re-test Status  | Not yet re-tested / Fixed - confirmed / Fixed - not confirmed / Still present / Won't fix (reason) |

| Test ID         | Result  | Finding ID / severity | Evidence | Owner                             | Fix PR / commit | Re-test environment and result |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Example: ST4/K3 | Not run | —                     | —        | Accessibility / tester unassigned | —               | —                              |

P0 blocks a core task without a workable path; P1 severely degrades it; P2 is a minor real barrier; P3 has low practical impact. Use the highest applicable impact and account for shared-component reach. These are triage judgements to review using the baseline scale.

Re-test a fix using the original failing setup and the relevant shared-component student/staff paths, then record the exact fix SHA. The pack itself still needs an independent contributor walkthrough. The [earlier validation](../A11Y-V01-validation-notes.md) records two outstanding independent U1 reviews; neither document marks them complete.
