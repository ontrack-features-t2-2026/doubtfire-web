# CAL-UX01: Placement and styling of the calendar controls

This note records where each calendar control was placed and why. The controls were built to match the app's existing Material markup and icon conventions so they read as native rather than bolted on, which is what this ticket set out to ensure.

- **Add to Google Calendar (CAL-F01):** in the task description card's action row, as a `mat-stroked-button` with a `mat-icon` sized to match the existing Task Sheet and Resources buttons already in that row.
- **Download .ics and its options (CAL-F02, F06, F07):** in the Progress Dashboard's "Plan Your Tasks" card, beside the existing "View Task Planner" button. The grade selector mirrors the Task Planner's Target Grade `mat-select`, and the exclude-completed control is a standard `mat-checkbox`, so the card keeps one visual language.
- **Header calendar button (CAL-F04):** a `mat-icon-button` beside the QR icon in the header, with a tooltip. It is intentionally unguarded, since WebCal is a global feed rather than a unit-scoped action.
- **Download a copy (CAL-F08):** in the Web calendar modal, next to the subscription URL controls, so subscribe and download sit together.

Conclusion: every control shipped following an existing pattern in the same surface it lives in, so no separate mockup deliverable is needed. This note is the placement rationale, and closes the ticket.
