# First-Time OnTrack Tutorial implementation

TUT-W01–W04, TUT-S01, TUT-T01, TUT-Q01 and TUT-MVP01. This is the reviewable
implementation handover, not a claim of release or human approval. The tutorial
is disabled unless authenticated settings explicitly return `tutorialEnabled: true`.

The [student and contributor guides](https://github.com/ontrack-features-t2-2026/github-guide/tree/main/docs/student-onboarding)
remain the central written guidance. The account menu now contains **Tutorial and Help**
for authenticated students after profile and data loading, when the institution
has enabled the feature. The written guide is also linked from every tutorial panel.

## Architecture and maintenance

- [Shell](../../src/app/student-onboarding/student-onboarding.component.ts): welcome,
  four guided steps, confirmation and completion. Existing CDK focus trapping is
  used for modal panels; guided steps remain non-modal. Escape follows the
  [prototype keyboard contract](https://github.com/ontrack-features-t2-2026/github-guide/blob/main/docs/design/student-onboarding-prototype-review/keyboard-and-focus.md).
- [Registry](../../src/app/student-onboarding/student-onboarding.steps.ts): version,
  stable ID, route context, target, exact DOC-11 title/body, locate-action label and
  missing-target fallback. Route is explanatory metadata, never an automatic
  navigation instruction. Students choose their own unit and navigate themselves.
- [Service](../../src/app/student-onboarding/student-onboarding.service.ts): readiness,
  own-user history check, browser progress, transitions and replay. It never writes
  the existing profile setup flag, assessment data or Calendar settings.
- [Target resolver](../../src/app/student-onboarding/student-onboarding-target.ts):
  visible explicit `data-onboarding-target` attributes; rejects selector input.
  DOM changes, resize and scroll refresh highlights without activating controls.

| Step | Stable target | Real location / fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Choose Your Unit | `unit-selector` | Header unit dropdown (both selected and unselected states). No units: explain enrolment support. |
| Find Your Tasks | `task-dashboard` | Current project navigation menu trigger. No selected project: explain Select Unit then Dashboard. |
| Check Your Target Grade | `target-grade` | Dashboard Select Target Grade control; unavailable/hidden: explain its location and continue. |
| Use the Calendar | `calendar` | Existing desktop Calendar button or visible account-menu Calendar entry. Narrow screens: explain account menu, then Calendar. |

`account-menu` is the permanent focus-return fallback, not a fifth tutorial step.
The tutorial does not click a menu, select a unit, navigate a route, change a grade,
create a subscription or submit a task. **Find…** only scrolls the current target
into view following an explicit user click. No extra tour dependency was added.

To update a step, edit the approved [DOC-11 copy source](https://github.com/ontrack-features-t2-2026/github-guide/blob/main/onboarding-tutorial-step-copy.md)
and registry together. Keep IDs stable when reordering. A material add/remove,
reorder, route/target move or meaning change increments `ONBOARDING_VERSION`.
Spelling corrections do not. Existing completion/dismissal survives version changes;
incomplete older versions restart from the beginning. Update target, fallback and
version tests before retiring an ID. Never reuse an old ID for another purpose.

## Eligibility, persistence and failures

The [DOC-10 / TUT-D03 contract](https://github.com/ontrack-features-t2-2026/github-guide/blob/main/onboarding-tutorial-trigger-and-state-rules.md)
contains the decision table. Automatic eligibility requires observing incomplete
profile setup and a successful current-user history request returning **zero**
projects, including inactive projects. The request uses `GET /projects` with
`include_inactive=true`, `include_task_definitions=false`, `page=1`, `per_page=1`;
one row is enough to disqualify the automatic offer. Authentication supplies the
owner. No user ID is sent and no project data is retained.

This intentionally excludes some newly enrolled students who already have a
project. Unknown/error/non-empty history is replay-only. An empty active-project
cache does not establish newness. Profile and globals must then finish loading;
welcome, profile editing, sign-in/out and SCORM routes cannot be interrupted.

Browser progress is exactly `{version,state,step}` under
`ontrack:student-onboarding:<authenticated user id>`. States are `new`,
`in-progress`, `skipped`, `dismissed`, `completed`; step IDs are from the registry.
The key scopes normal use to the current account but is not an authorization
boundary against another person using the same browser profile.

Start/Back/Next save `in-progress`; a new session resumes its current-version step.
Skip/Close save `skipped`, suppressing repeats this session. The skip confirmation
separately explains permanent dismissal. Completed/dismissed decisions are not
re-prompted, including after a version bump. Replay always begins at the welcome
panel and leaves the entire saved automatic decision unchanged. Sign-out or flag
off closes the shell and clears only memory. Storage corruption, future schemas,
read/write failures and a failed/timed-out history request fail open to normal use.

## Validation and handover

See [test traceability and QA](validation.md) and the [threat model](threat-model.md).
The original welcome/profile component and its tests remain in place. The API
change PR-TUT-17 supplies a default-false environment switch; no tutorial progress
endpoint, database migration or deployment change is required by this frontend.

Status: implemented for PR review, with release/pilot decisions pending. Existing
TUT-UX01 prototype documents explicitly record pending human approvals. Do not
report those as completed, and do not enable the tutorial for a cohort solely
because the automated checks pass. TUT-U01-RUN needs real representative reviewers;
TUT-U01-FIXES depends on actual findings. No participant feedback, recordings,
second-contributor review or approval has been invented here. TUT-D04's final
walkthrough and manual acceptance evidence remain review handover items.
